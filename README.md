Mindful Escape is a project produced by six LMU freshmen intended to address and alleviate common sources of stress in the lives of teenagers, including but not limited to school, friendships, self-image, and family. Our website will help you identify what is causing stress in your life with its various features: a simple quiz, self-care advice and resources, and a forum that connects you to others undergoing similar struggles.

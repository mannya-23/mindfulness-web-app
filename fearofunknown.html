      <h2>Stress Over the Future: The Unknown</h2>
      <p>Growing up comes with a lot of challenges as well as new freedom: being able to decide what you want to do in the future, to live and go where you want, and to make huge lifestyle changes. This comes with a lot of stress about what decisions to make and what lies ahead of you, whether it be college, the workforce, or other major life path branches.</p>

      <h2>Circumstantial Stress</h2>
      <p>It's easy to feel like you have no control over your life and that there is no way to prevent bad things from happening to you. Sometimes, the future seems so bleak that it doesn't even seem worth it to try and make things better for yourself. However, it is always worthwhile to keep trying and strive for something better-- no matter how improbable it may seem.</p>

      <ul class="stress-page-list">
        <li class="stress-page-list-item">Ground yourself, focus on the small things, and let yourself feel whatever it is you're feeling.
        </li>
        <li class="stress-page-list-item">When there is something you can change, go for it! But sometimes, circumstances can't be changed as easily, but there is always something you can be doing to help.
        </li>
        <li class="stress-page-list-item">Talk to trusted individuals about how you're feeling about your
 circumstances, whether that is a family member or close friend. Don't bottle up your feelings because you may think there's no
 point in talking about it. The circumstances may be bigger than yourself, but that doesn't mean your feelings should be brushed aside.</li>

      <h2>About the Developers</h2>
      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p id = "aboutusblurb">For our CSSI final project, we decided to create Mindful Escape, a wellness & self-care Web App aimed to
      help individuals identify what is causing them stress and connect them to solutions. Mental health is an
      increasingly apparent problem and the goal of Mindful Escape is to provide you with advice, quotes, and a
      community that helps you feel supported. You are NEVER alone and if you ever need an escape from reality, Mindful
      Escape is there for you.</p>

          <h4>Addy</h4>
          <p>Hi! I'm Addy, and I'm from San Francisco, CA. I was torn between what I wanted to do in college, but I knew video games was something I was passionate about. My interest in tech was confirmed as I saw a drone show and was able to be introduced to the behind the scenes, to which I then knew I wanted to do something that made others smile. I enjoy drawing and listening to music! </p>

          <h4>Amelie</h4>
          <p>Hello! I'm Amelie and I'm an incoming CS major from Houston, Texas. I'm moving to LA soon so I'm excited to experience not hot weather. I took a web design class in highschool, loved it, and proceeded to take almost all CS classes offered! Some of my hobbies include baking, reading, and doing anything outdoors/in nature! </p>

          <h4>Cara</h4>
          <p>Hello! My name's Cara and I'm a CS major from Huntington Beach, California. Since middle school, I've always been fascinated with robotics and the idea of making a hard task simpler through programming -- so, Mindful Escape sounded like a really fun idea to bring to life. Outside of CS, I also enjoy listening to music, going to shows, and cafe hopping :)</p>

          <h4>Mannya</h4>
          <p>Hi! My name's Mannya and I'm an incoming statistics & data science major from Fremont, California. I've never truly exposed myself to computer science before participating in CSSI. However, being a part of this program has made me realize I love how code comes together to create a final product. Aside from CS, I love listening to music, hiking, and exploring new places!</p>

          <h4>Milka</h4>
          <p>Hi! I'm Milka, a CS major (& hopefully soon theater minor!) from LA. I started coding with a fun middle school program that motivated me with Oreos and throughout high school have enjoyed using code to create solutions to the societal issues around us. I love to code, act, go to the beach, and another fun hobby is that I play ping pong with a passion! P.S. - "Marigold", a resource on the Work Stress page, was one of my past group projects!</p>

          <h4>Vanessa</h4>
          <p>Hello! I'm Vanessa and I'm an EECS major from Santa Clarita, CA. I started coding in 8th grade after taking my first programming class using Scratch. I gathered my experncie since then through summer programs like Girls Who Code and Boston Scientific. Outside of school I love to design, hang out with my friends, listen to music, and read novels.</p>

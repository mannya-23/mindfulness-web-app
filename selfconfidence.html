        <h2>Self-Image and Confidence-Related Stress</h2>
        <p>Anxiety and low self-image is a universal feeling, and you are not alone in thinking you aren't good enough or that you're inferior to your peers. Keep in mind that you're your own biggest critic and often other people don't notice the flaws and imperfections about yourself that you do. Surround yourself with people who remind you of your own self-worth and recognize unnecessary negative self-talk when it happens.</p>

        <h3 class="desctitle">How to De-stress</h3>
        <ul class="stress-page-list">
          <li class="stress-page-list-item">Remind yourself that everytime you achieve something, it's because you put
            in
            the work to get there, no matter what anyone else or the little voice in your head says.</li>
          <li class="stress-page-list-item">Lucky and deserving are very different concepts: one is an accident, and the
            other
            a reward for your efforts.</li>
          <li class="stress-page-list-item">Don't brush off compliments! When you give out compliments, do you mean
            them?
            Do
            you think those around you mean them? Those who care for you wouldn't talk up a talent they don't think
            exists
            -
            you're amazing!</li>
          <li class="stress-page-list-item">If relationships with others are the origin for these thoughts, address
            that.
            Whether that means distancing from bullies or having a conversation with those you're close to about how
            they
            talk to/about you, make sure your environment is an uplifting one.</li>
          <li class="stress-page-list-item">Find the ones who will build you up the way you would for them and spend
            your
            time with these amazing beings!</li>
          <li class="stress-page-list-item">You may need to reflect on why you think the way you do about yourself: Is it based on past experiences? Are those people still in your life? Many of the times people put themselves down over things they have no control over, or by something that was said in the past. It is important to reflect on what's causing pain and work to see yourself in a different light.
